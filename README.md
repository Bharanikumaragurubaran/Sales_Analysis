# Sales-Analysis
Here I have taken 12 months worth of Sales Data and made some cleaning, preprocessing, analysis and visualisation on product sales.
## Datasets used
Monthly Sales data for all 12 months, files can be found in <b>Sales Data</b> folder
## Process
<ul>
  <li>As a first step I have gathered data from all 12 month datasets and stored it in <i>all_data.csv</i> file</li>
  <li>Next is <b>Data cleaning & Preprocessing</b> to get clean and proper dataset. As a part of pre processing I have added some new columns in datasets to make it more meaningfull</li>
  <li>After getting complete dataset, I started to explore deep into dataset to find answers to below questions.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Finding which month produced max sales</li>
    <li>Finding which city produced maximum sales</li>
    <li>What time should we display advertisements to maximise sales</li>
    <li>What products are often sold together</li>
    <li>Finding which product had maximum sales and why</li>
  </ol>
  <li>And I visualized below data as graphs in ipynb file</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Visualizing monthly Sales data</li>
    <li>Visualizing Sales data on each city</li>
    <li>Sales acheived by hours (for all cities and specifically for San Fransisco)</li>
    <li>Product sales - count</li>
    <li>Product sales - count and adding Price as secondary y axis</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
